# WebRequester
This is my first script I post to GitHub! This is a simple program for sending a custom string of ASCII characters to any webhook URL!
Fully tested, works as expected.

IMPORTANT: before running this script, you need to get the python extension: requests. 
I would add this function directly to the program, but it keeps giving me errors and there are too many commands for different OSes.

On Kali Linux (Externally managed):

sudo apt install python3-requests

On Kali Linux:

pip install requests

On macOS (or Linux):

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

brew install python3

brew install pip

pip install requests
